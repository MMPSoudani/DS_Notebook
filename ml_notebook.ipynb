    "#### Machines perform tasks given by the instructor. These tasks needs to be described in a way that the machine can understand them. Oftentimes, the instructor needs to describe the steps the machine needs to take in order for the machine to perform that task. In this case, machine learning is a process that allows the machine to learn and understand how to perform its given tasks and also how to use the gained knowledge to perform more complex tasks.\n",

The computer algorithm takes the input and the instructions then creates an output. the machine learning algoritm takes the input and the output and tries to learn the instructions for producing the output."

    "#### In the field of computer science, the most general concept is AI (Artificial Intelligence) which is human intelligence exhibited by machines, in other words, AI is a machine that acts like a human. Nowadays AIs can perform specific task very well, but a general AI that can perform a wide verity of tasks is much harder to create. Machine learning is a subset of AI which is an approach to achieve AI by systems that finds patterns in a set of data. Machine learning is the science of getting machines to act without explicitly programming them. Deep learning is a technique or a type of algorithm for implementing machine learning.\n",

    "- machine learning, which refers to using the patterns in order to make an accurate prediction. Both fields are inter-connected and experts needs to learn them both.\n",

Spreadsheets like excel or csv files help companies to save their generated data like customes or sales. Analysing these sheets helps companies to make business decisions.\n",

    "#### As the companies gained more data and information, the relational database was invented to better organize those data using a language called SQL for saving and quering the data. Over the years the amount of data generated by companies and users grow so much that containing them in an spreadsheet or a relational database wasn't efficient, thus NoSQL database were invented. The big data generated daily, requires machines to be analyzed and produce Information and knowledge. Thus the field of machine learning was born."
